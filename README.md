# UI-UX-Experiment4

## Aim:

To design a mobile application wireframe that demonstrates the core user flow of a social media platform (LinkedIn-style) with essential screens — Welcome, Login, Home Feed, Post Creation, and Profile/Interaction. The goal is to visually represent how users navigate and interact within the app.

## Algorithm:


## 1.Identify the purpose of the app:
  The app allows users to connect professionally, share posts, and interact with other users.

  
## 2.Decide on the main screens:
  Welcome Screen

Login Screen

Home Feed Screen

Post Creation Screen

Profile/Interaction Screen


## 3.Plan layout and content for each screen:
Include navigation icons, buttons, search bar, text fields, and media sections.

## 4.Use a wireframing tool (Balsamiq) :
To sketch each screen clearly, maintaining consistency in layout.
## 5.Arrange UI elements :
Such as logos, icons, post buttons, and keyboard input for realism.
## 6.Connect the screens :
Logically to show the user flow — from Welcome → Login → Home → Create Post → Interaction.
## 7.Review the wireframes :
To ensure clarity, simplicity, and user-friendliness in the design.


## Output:

## Result:
  A complete mobile app wireframe was created using Balsamiq, showing five main screens that represent the app’s user journey. The design starts with a welcome page, proceeds to the login screen, transitions to the home feed, allows post creation, and ends with a profile or interaction screen, effectively demonstrating the navigation flow and user experience of the application.
